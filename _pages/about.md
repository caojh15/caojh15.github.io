Jiahao Cao is an Assistant Research Professor at the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace (INSC), Tsinghua University. Before joining in INSC, he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. He received his Ph.D. Degree at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University in 2020 (advised by Professors [Mingwei Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xL6zuCMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Qi Li](https://sites.google.com/site/qili2012/)). He was a visiting scholar at George Mason University's Center for Secure Information Systems (CSIS), funded by a China Scholarship Council (CSC) Scholarship, working with Professor [Kun Sun](https://csis.gmu.edu/ksun/).

He is broadly interested in security research related to networking protocols and systems. *He has published many papers in top-tier conferences and journals such as NDSS, ACM CCS, USENIX Security, INFOCOM, TIFS, ToN*. Additionally, he has discovered numerous vulnerabilities in various networking systems, many of which have been assigned CVE, CNVD, or CNNVD numbers, affecting a wide range of switches and routers. He was awarded the *ACM SIGSAC China Doctoral Dissertation Award* (2021), recognized as a *Shuimu Tsinghua Scholar* (2021), named an Excellent Ph.D. Graduate in the Department of CST at Tsinghua University (2020), and earned the *Best Paper Award* at EAI SecureComm 2017. His current interests mainly focus on the following domains: 
- AI-Driven Network Attack Detection (e.g., malicious flows detection, routing anamoly detection)
- Network Protocol Security (e.g., discovering network protocol vulnerabilities through fuzzing or manual analysis)
- High-Performance Network Transmission Optimization (e.g., RDMA Transmission Optimization) 

**He is always looking for highly motivated postdocs, students, and research interns to join the group! If you're interested, feel free to reach out via email (caojh2021@tsinghua.edu.cn).**
