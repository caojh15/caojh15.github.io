Jiahao Cao is an Assistant Research Professor at the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace (INSC), Tsinghua University. He also serves as the primary leader responsible for security development in the Future Internet Technology Infrastructure  ([FITI](https://english.news.cn/20231113/03cca2c31e654655b3473830500c9bb5/c.html))  project in China. Before joining in INSC, he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. He received his Ph.D. Degree at Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University in 2020 (advised by Professors [Mingwei Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xL6zuCMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Qi Li](https://sites.google.com/site/qili2012/)). He was a visiting scholar at George Mason University's Center for Secure Information Systems (CSIS), funded by a China Scholarship Council (CSC) Scholarship, working with Professor [Kun Sun](https://csis.gmu.edu/ksun/).

He is broadly interested in security research related to networking protocols and systems. *He has published many papers in top-tier conferences and journals such as NDSS, ACM CCS, USENIX Security, INFOCOM, TIFS, ToN*. Additionally, he has discovered numerous vulnerabilities in various networking systems, many of which have been assigned CVE, CNVD, or CNNVD numbers, affecting a wide range of switches and routers. He was awarded the *ACM SIGSAC China Doctoral Dissertation Award* (2021), recognized as a *Shuimu Tsinghua Scholar* (2021), named an Excellent Ph.D. Graduate in the Department of CST at Tsinghua University (2020), and earned the *Best Paper Award* at EAI SecureComm 2017. 

His current interests mainly focus on the following domains: 
- Network Traffic Analysis (e.g., VPN/Censorship Identification, Network Attack Detection)
- Network Protocol Security (e.g., RDMA/BGP/RPKI/OpenFlow Vulnerability Discovery through Fuzzing or Manual Analysis)
   

**He is always looking for highly motivated postdocs, students, and research interns to join the group! If you're interested, feel free to reach out via email (caojh2021@tsinghua.edu.cn).**
